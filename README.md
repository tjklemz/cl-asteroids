# cl-asteroids
Asteroids game from our Saturday Code and Coffee sessions

## Requirements
You'll need `glfw3`, OpenGL libraries, a 64-bit lisp, and Quicklisp installed.

For convenience, quicklisp is included. To install it, start lisp from this directory, then `(load "quicklisp")` and follow the directions.

## Running
It's in demo state right now. To run, start lisp, then `(load "main")` and `(in-package #:myapp)` and `(run-example)`
